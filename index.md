### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    One of my favorite labs this semester was Lab 12, both parts. We learned to work with color 
    and animation.  It involved a new concept of code and implemented object oriented 
    programming, making it interesting to create.

* Lab 3 

    Lab 3 part 1 was another one of my favorites.  It was entertaining to create a program 
    that sees how many days there are until our next birthday.  We learned to work 
    with equations and formulas in code, and had some practice on using std::cout.

* Lab 7

    Another one of my Favorite Labs was lab 7 part 2.  We started to implement functions
    more into code with this lab. Creating a program that consists of mostly 
    functions in order to display what times are appropriate to park was interesting and 
    entertaining to do.
